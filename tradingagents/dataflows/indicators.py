"""Technical-indicator window formatting, shared by every price vendor.

Indicators are computed here rather than fetched from a vendor: every vendor
only supplies daily bars, and ``stockstats`` derives the indicator from them. So
the window rendering is vendor-neutral and the only variable is which vendor
``load_ohlcv`` reads the bars from. Each vendor's own module pins that with a
thin wrapper (``y_finance.get_stock_stats_indicators_window`` for Yahoo,
``tdx_stock.get_tdx_indicators_window`` for TDX) so the router's fallback chain
reaches the backend it selected instead of re-resolving from configuration.
